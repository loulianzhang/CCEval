# CCEval
CCEval, an impartial and representative Chinese-centric MMT evaluation dataset

We propose CCEval, an impartial and representative Chinese-centric MMT evaluation
dataset. This benchmark dataset consists of
2500 Chinese sentences we meticulously selected and processed, and covers more diverse
linguistic features as compared to other MMT
evaluation benchmarks. These sentences have
been translated into 11 languages of various
resource levels by professional translators via a
rigorously controlled process pipeline to ensure their high quality.
